bugs:

todo:
=====
* select which type of packages should be routed (rc-channels, link-stats)
* menu: range of rewrite addresses
* indication of table overrun
* menu: display routing table
* self-refresh to detect stale devices
* add special cases for TX-module / RX / Handset
* add cross-routing to other modules (routing between modules, not to receiver)

problems:
=====
* widget send commands allways to dest=0xc8 -> no routing takes place
** widget should use broadcast address 0x00 for commands
** elrs V4: routing of command packages with broadcast destination, does it work? (yes)

done:
=====
* add all interfaces
* learning addresses / setup routing table on power-up (without TBS agent or elrsV3.lua)
** startup state: send rc-channels (0 channel values) together with ping packets (and maybe link-stats) interleaved
* basic routing
** workaround: use 0xc8 as quasi-broadcast for commands
** menu: set quasi-broadcast address
