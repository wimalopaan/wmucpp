bugs:
=====

todo:
=====
* allow more baudrates for relay (e.g. 115200Bd for IR-Connection)
* failsafe mode
* watchdog
* menu: option to swap rx/tx uart lines (for outgoing: layout like receiver)
* indication of table overrun
* menu: display routing table
* self-refresh to detect stale devices

done:
=====
* menu: range of rewrite addresses
* enable telemetry tunnel type specific -> menu options for all types of sensors
* add support for external tx-module (or rx-as-tx)
** for half-duplex or full-duplex
** menu option: name replacement, addresses, telemetry tunnel
* telemetry tunnel for telemetry messages
* add special cases for TX-module / RX / Handset
* add cross-routing to other modules (routing between modules, not to receiver)
* select which type of packages should be routed (rc-channels, link-stats)
* add all interfaces
* learning addresses / setup routing table on power-up (without TBS agent or elrsV3.lua)
** startup state: send rc-channels (0 channel values) together with ping packets (and maybe link-stats) interleaved
* basic routing
** workaround: use 0xc8 as quasi-broadcast for commands
** menu: set quasi-broadcast address
