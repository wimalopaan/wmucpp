ToDo:
=====
* preprocessor structure (USE_...)
* CRSF-Output (with CRSF MultiSwitch Support)
** CH1-8:  analog input (maybe also 3-pos switches)
** CH9-12: binary switches (maybe usefull on PWM ELRS Empfänger: set output to on/off)

Done:
=====
* state machine / button events
* analog calibration
* config protocol -> widget
* support for 3-pos switches
