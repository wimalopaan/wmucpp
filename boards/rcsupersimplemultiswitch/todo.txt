limitations:
============
* does not use the RESPONSE_SLOT algorithm (and no open-drain tx-line),
therefore only one module should send telemetry data ro the RX.
If modules are parallelized only one should be connected its tx-line to the receivers-rx line.
Alternative two modules using telemetry can be connected to different serial connections of
the receiver, or the CRSF-switch/router has to be used.

todo:
======
* blinkpattern
** 1x no serial packages at all
** 2x normal (command received)
** 3x only linkstat or rc-channels
* scaling of adc
** temp (fix also sample time of adc)
** voltage

done:
=====
* modity passthru message: include address
* modify crsf-address according to address-pins
* sending of status bits
** passthru frames

* gfsm structure
** with telemetry
** no telemetry
