Bugs:
=====

ToDo:
=====
* watchdog (show watchdog counter in menu)
* correct docu (RX and TX interchanged, A11 for half-duplex TX module)
* adc input: voltage, temperature

Done:
=====
* allow more baudrates (e.g. 115200Bd for IR-Connection)
* option to select IrDa-SIR mode
* adapt to own stm32g0b1 board
* make LUA-widget to grab tunneled telemetry
* refactor packet_relay_rewrite
* enable telemetry tunnel type specific -> menu options for all types of sensors
* explicit failsafe mode (menu: hold, forward, zero, ...)
* failsafe: switch off relay if no input anymore
* blink pattern for no-input signal (single flash)
* telemetry tunnel for telemetry messages
** maybe too much load? store/forward using slower rate?
* move update-from-eeprom to later state, and move crsf/relay init to early state
* add half-duplex relay mode
* configure relay telemetry (actual all except link stats) is send
* encapsulte secondary link stat packages
