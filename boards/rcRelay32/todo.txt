Bugs:
=====
* telemetry tunnel for telemetry messages

ToDo:
=====
* correct docu (RX and TX interchanged, A11 for half-duplex TX module)
* adc input: voltage, temperature
* adapt to own stm32g031 board

Done:
=====
* blink pattern for no-input signal (single flash)
* move update-from-eeprom to later state, and move crsf/relay init to early state
* add half-duplex relay mode
* configure relay telemetry (actual all except link stats) is send
* encapsulte secondary link stat packages
