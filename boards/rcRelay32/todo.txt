Bugs:
=====

ToDo:
=====
* enable telemetry tunnel type specific -> menu options for all types of sensors
* wathdog (show watchdog counter in menu)
* refactor packet_relay_rewrite
* correct docu (RX and TX interchanged, A11 for half-duplex TX module)
* adc input: voltage, temperature
* make LUA-widget to grab tunneled telemetry
* adapt to own stm32g031 board

Done:
=====
* explicit failsafe mode (menu: hold, forward, zero, ...)
* failsafe: switch off relay if no input anymore
* blink pattern for no-input signal (single flash)
* telemetry tunnel for telemetry messages
** maybe too much load? store/forward using slower rate?
* move update-from-eeprom to later state, and move crsf/relay init to early state
* add half-duplex relay mode
* configure relay telemetry (actual all except link stats) is send
* encapsulte secondary link stat packages
